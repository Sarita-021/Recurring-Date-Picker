## üé® Styling Approach

This project uses a powerful hybrid styling strategy:

1.  **Tailwind CSS**: Used for the overall layout, grid, flexbox, and utility classes directly within the JSX for rapid development.
2.  **Custom CSS Files**: Located in `src/styles`, these files provide more complex, component-specific styles and a centralized theme using CSS variables (`variables.css`). This approach keeps the JSX clean while allowing for sophisticated and maintainable styling.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* **Integrate a Date Library**: Replace the custom date logic with a robust library like `date-fns` or `day.js` to handle timezones and edge cases more effectively.
* **Add More Recurrence Patterns**: Implement more complex rules, such as "the last weekday of the month."
* **Accessibility (a11y)**: Enhance keyboard navigation and add ARIA attributes for better screen reader support.
* **State Management**: For larger applications, consider integrating a state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
